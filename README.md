# Car price prediction - ML regression project

Analyzed a dataset containing car attributes such as make, model, engine size, etc. After cleaning and visualizing the data, I built a predictive model using a Random Forest Regression algorithm. 
The model achieved a high R-squared, predicting 96% of prices. The RMSE equals $3278, MAE equals $2294. 
Given that car prices are 10, sometimes 100, times larger, so the errors are low, suggesting that the model is well-constructed
